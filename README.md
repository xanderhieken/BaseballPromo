# Using Data to Improve a Marketing Promotion for the LA Dodgers
For this project, I was asked to evaluate data from the 2012 season to help select a promotion with the highest potential to increase attendance.

### Project Guidelines
1. You must use both Python and R in some capacity.
2. You must demonstrate the use of Box Plots, Scatter Plots, and a Regression Model

## The Data
In the data folder of the GitHub repository, you will see `dodgers.csv`, which contains a variety of information from the Dodgers' 2012 season.
